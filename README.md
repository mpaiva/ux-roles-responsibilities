### Key Terms

- **IC (Individual Contributor)**:  
  Refers to non-managerial employees who focus on task execution rather than people management. ICs typically work on specific projects or tasks assigned by a manager or lead and are responsible for delivering high-quality work in their area of expertise.

- **A11y (Accessibility)**:  
  An abbreviation for "accessibility," where the number 11 represents the number of letters between the first and last letters of the word. Accessibility refers to the design and development of systems, tools, and environments that can be used by people with disabilities, ensuring inclusivity and usability for all.

- **Triad**:  
  A collaborative structure in which the **UX lead**, **Product lead**, and **Development lead** work closely together to ensure that design, product, and technical considerations are aligned. The triad is responsible for making key decisions that balance user needs, product strategy, and development feasibility.

- **UX (User Experience)**:  
  Refers to the overall experience a person has when interacting with a product or service, including how easy or enjoyable it is to use. UX design focuses on improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.

- **UI (User Interface)**:  
  The part of a product or system with which the user interacts directly, such as buttons, menus, and icons on a website or application. UI design is focused on creating visually appealing and functional interfaces that enable smooth user interaction.

- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**:  
  A set of internationally recognized standards designed to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG provides detailed guidelines for ensuring that digital content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.

- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**:  
  A U.S. law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places open to the general public. In digital spaces, the ADA requires websites and other online services to be accessible to people with disabilities.

- **Section 508**:  
  A part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (amended in 1998) that requires federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 sets standards for web accessibility for federal websites and IT tools, similar to WCAG guidelines.

- **Design System**:  
  A set of standardized guidelines, principles, and reusable components (such as UI elements) used to create a consistent design across multiple products or services. A design system ensures that teams work with the same tools and standards, leading to coherent, accessible, and scalable designs.

- **T-Shirt Sizing**:  
  A common technique used in agile teams to estimate the relative effort or complexity of tasks. Tasks are given a size similar to clothing sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL) to indicate their difficulty or time required to complete.

- **Cross-Domain Knowledge**:  
  The understanding and expertise that span multiple areas or disciplines, such as combining knowledge of user experience, technical development, and product management. Having cross-domain knowledge enables team members to contribute more holistically and collaborate effectively across different functional areas.

- **Roadmap**:  
  A high-level plan that outlines the direction, goals, and milestones for a product or project over time. A roadmap typically includes key initiatives and features to be developed, along with their priority and expected delivery timelines. It helps teams align their work with strategic goals.

- **Backlog**:  
  A prioritized list of tasks or features that a team plans to work on, typically managed in an agile development process. Items in the backlog are refined and scheduled for development in upcoming sprints or iterations based on their importance and feasibility.

- **Sprint**:  
  A short, time-boxed period (usually 1 to 4 weeks) during which a specific set of tasks or features are developed and completed by a team. Sprints are part of the agile development process, and at the end of each sprint, the team reviews and potentially releases the work that was completed.

- **Stakeholder**:  
  Any person, group, or organization that has an interest in the outcome of a project. Stakeholders can include internal team members, such as product managers and developers, as well as external groups, such as clients, users, or regulatory bodies.

- **Mentorship**:  
  A relationship in which a more experienced individual (the mentor) provides guidance, support, and knowledge to a less experienced person (the mentee) to help them develop professionally. Mentorship often includes advice on skill development, career growth, and problem-solving.

- **Discovery Phase**:  
  The early stage of a project where research and analysis are conducted to understand the problem space, user needs, and business goals. The discovery phase is crucial for defining the project's scope, identifying potential solutions, and aligning the team on a shared vision.

- **Formative Research**:  
  A type of research conducted during the early stages of design to gather insights about user behaviors, needs, and challenges. Formative research helps shape the design direction and strategy by providing a deeper understanding of the target audience.

- **Design Review**:  
  A process where a design team presents their work to stakeholders, peers, or leadership for feedback. The review focuses on ensuring the design meets user needs, adheres to design principles, and aligns with project goals. Feedback is used to iterate and improve the design before final implementation.

- **Planning Tool**:  
  Software or tools used to organize, prioritize, and manage tasks and projects. Planning tools help teams track progress, assign work, set deadlines, and ensure that resources are allocated efficiently.

- **Grooming Session**:  
  A meeting held by a team to review and refine the items in the backlog, ensuring that tasks are clearly defined and prioritized before the team starts working on them. Grooming sessions help maintain an up-to-date backlog that reflects the project’s priorities and readiness for development.
